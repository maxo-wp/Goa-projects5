        Goal orientation, or achievement orientation, is an "individual disposition towards developing or validating one's ability in achievement settings".[1] In general, an individual can be said to be mastery or performance oriented, based on whether one's goal is to develop one's ability or to demonstrate one's ability, respectively.[2] A mastery orientation is also sometimes referred to as a learning orientation.
